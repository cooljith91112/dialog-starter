<hr/>

This repo contains starter kit for developing Interactive Fiction using [`Dialog language`][dialog]. Includes a powershell script to generate a web version of the game

> Script assumes you have already installed [`dialog`][dialog] and [`Ã…-machine VM`][a-machine] in your system path. Also you have to copy stdlib.dg from the dialog folder to your game root path.

### IFID
